### System III: Domain Knowledge for Safety in RL

This repository contains the implementation of System III, a novel framework focused on enhancing safety in reinforcement learning (RL) through the incorporation of domain knowledge.

Highlights

Leverages domain expert knowledge, represented using first-order logic.
Aims for safer exploration in RL environments, crucial for safety-critical domains.
Evaluated on OpenAIâ€™s Gym and Safety-Gym environments, showing improved sample efficiency.
